# Introduction

Alpine.js offers you the reactive and declarative nature of big frameworks like Vue or React at a much lower cost.

You get to keep your DOM, and sprinkle in behavior as you see fit.

Think of it like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for JavaScript.

> This tool's syntax is almost entirely borrowed from [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (and by extension [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)). I am forever grateful for the gift they are to the web.
